# Iggy-POC is a graph coloring model created by Bertrand Miannay to :
- Identify subnetworks from a prior knowledge network.
- Compute the maximal similarity with each subnetwork from a set of observations.

# To try a toy example, the toyExample.sh file allows to use the framework on a small network :
chmod 777 toyExample.sh

./toyExample.sh
